# Basic Math

### Probability 
```
P(a||b) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a && b)
```
### Sum of first N natural numbers
Group first with last (arr[0] + arr[arr.length -a])
```angular2
(n+1)n      n(n-1)
______       ____
2               2
```

### Slope of line - rise/run
```
delta Y / delta X
f(b) - f(a)
___________
    b - a
```

### Distance formula
```angular2
d = sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2)
```

### Prime numbers - divisible by 1 and itself
```angular2

```


### Pigeonhole principle 
if more pigeons than holes, at least one holes must have more than one pigeon
```angular2
people = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.length = n
minimum shakes = 0
maximum_shakes = people[n-1]
there must be 2 people who've shakine hands the same number of times
```

### GCD (greatest common divisor) and LCM (least common multiple)
```angular2
GCD(6, 21) = 3
6/2=3
21/7=3
common footer = 2,3,7

LCM(6, 21) = 42
2*3*7 = 42
```

### Exclusion/Inclusion
```angular2

``` 

### Decimal and binary
```angular2

```

### Quadratic equation
x = (-b +/- Math.sqrt(Math.pow(b, 2) - 4ac)) / 2
```angular2

```


#Mean, Median, Mode
```angular2
mean = average = (sum / length)

median = mean of sorted middle numbs

mode = most frequenly ocurring number
```
