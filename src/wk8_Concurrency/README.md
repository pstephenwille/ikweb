# Concurrency

### Parallelsim vs Concurrency
Parallel - run A and B simultaneously

Concurrency - run part of A, then run part of B

Spurious wait - use while()

Thread no blocked - eligible to run

Atomi op - OS sees thread as running

Buys-wait - thread is running in a loop waiting for a resource

Kernel Transition - user-mode to privileged operation from the kernel

Cross-process mutex vs mutex - 
enforce exclusive access to resource from threads in different processes
